Project based on Time Series Forecasting, Introduction to Data Science Project 5


Time Series Forecasting Approaches:<br>
1. XGBoost Regressor  <br>
2. FbProphet <br>


The following objectives were listed for the project

1.Download the product demand data set from 
https://www.kaggle.com/felixzhao/productdemandforecasting<br>
2.Load the data set into panda data frames </br>
3.Formulate one or two ideas on how feature engineering would help the
data set to establish additional value using exploratory data analysis </br>
4.Build one or more forecasting models to determine the demand for a
particular product using the other columns as features</br>
